The Froth library
-----------------

Froth provides partial Java bindings for the Steam API.

Building
--------

Invoke Ant with any of the following targets:

  all: builds the distribution files and javadoc documentation
  compile: builds only the class files (dist/classes)
  javadoc: builds only the javadoc documentation (dist/docs)
  dist: builds the distribution jar files (dist/*.jar)
  maven-deploy: deploys Maven artifacts to your local repository
  nativecompile: recompiles native libraries for the current platform (Linux, OS X, Windows)

Native Compilation
------------------

Before building the native libraries, you have to download the Steamworks SDK and put it in lib/.
The version of the SDK is defined in the `steamworks.sdk` variable in `build.xml`. So if you're
updating the SDK then update that value as well.

Linux should be straightforward; it just needs GCC.  If running on a 64-bit installation, you will
need to following 32-bit packages: libc6-dev-i386 g++-multilib

Windows requires Visual Studio C++ 2010 Express (http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/) and
the Windows SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924).  Run Ant from the SDK command
prompt shortcut.

OS X requires Clang.
