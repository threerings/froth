The Froth library
-----------------

Froth provides partial Java bindings for the Steam API.

Building
--------

Invoke Ant with any of the following targets:

  all: builds the distribution files and javadoc documentation
  compile: builds only the class files (dist/classes)
  javadoc: builds only the javadoc documentation (dist/docs)
  dist: builds the distribution jar files (dist/*.jar)
  maven-deploy: deploys Maven artifacts to your local repository
  nativecompile: recompiles native libraries for the current platform (Linux, OS X, Windows)

Native Compilation
------------------

Before building the native libraries, you have to download the Steamworks SDK and put it in lib/.
The version of the SDK is defined in the `steamworks.sdk` variable in `build.xml`. So if you're
updating the SDK then update that value as well.

Linux should be straightforward; it just needs GCC.

OS X requires Clang.

Windows requires Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022
(https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022), install
"Desktop development with C++". Only the MSVC compiler and Windows SDK are needed.
